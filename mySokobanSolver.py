IFN680 Sokoban Assignment

The functions and classes defined in this module will be called by a marker script. 
You should complete the functions and classes according to their specified interfaces.

You are not allowed to change the defined interfaces.
That is, changing the formal parameters of a function will break the 
interface and triggers to a fail for the test of your code.

    Identify the taboo cells of a warehouse. A cell inside a warehouse is 
    called 'taboo' if whenever a box get pushed on such a cell then the puzzle 
    becomes unsolvable.  
    When determining the taboo cells, you must ignore all the existing boxes, 
    simply consider the walls and the target cells.  
    Use only the following two rules to determine the taboo cells;
     Rule 1: if a cell is a corner inside the warehouse and not a target, 
             then it is a taboo cell.
     Rule 2: all the cells between two corners inside the warehouse along a 
             wall are taboo if none of these cells is a target.

    An instance of the class 'SokobanPuzzle' represents a Sokoban puzzle.
    An instance contains information about the walls, the targets, the boxes
    and the worker.

    Your implementation should be fully compatible with the search functions of 
    the provided module 'search.py'. It uses search.Problem as a sub-class. 
    That means, it should have a:
    - self.actions() function
    - self.result() function
    - self.goal_test() function
    See the Problem class in search.py for more details on these functions.
    
    Each instance should have at least the following attributes:
    - self.allow_taboo_push
    - self.macro
    
    When self.allow_taboo_push is set to True, the 'actions' function should 
    return all possible legal moves including those that move a box on a taboo 
    cell. If self.allow_taboo_push is set to False, those moves should not be
    included in the returned list of actions.
    
    If self.macro is set True, the 'actions' function should return 
    macro actions. If self.macro is set False, the 'actions' function should 
    return elementary actions.
